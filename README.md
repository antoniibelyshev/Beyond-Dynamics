# Beyond Dynamics

## Abstract

The discovery of conservation principles is crucial for understanding the fundamental behavior of both classical and quantum physical systems across numerous domains. This paper introduces an innovative method that merges representation learning and topological analysis to explore the topology of conservation law spaces. Notably, the robustness of our approach to noise makes it suitable for complex experimental setups and its aptitude extends to the analysis of quantum systems, as successfully demonstrated in our paper. We exemplify our method's potential to unearth previously unknown conservation principles and endorse interdisciplinary research through a variety of physical simulations. In conclusion, this work emphasizes the significance of data-driven techniques in deepening our comprehension of the principles governing classical and quantum physical systems.

## Running the code

This repository contains the code of the Metric Space Approximation and Projection model and numerical experiments showcasing the capability of the method on a few dynamical systems.

Scripts for generating the data can be found in ./data folder. The experiments are shown in the notebooks, each system in a separate notebook.
